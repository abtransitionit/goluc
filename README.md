# Getting Started  

## Developper
- the project uses codes form multiple GO projects (e.g : `gocore`, `golinux`, `gotask`).

## 1. Create a repository from this template (e.g. `gomine`)
- on `github.com` create `gomine` : an empty git repo without `README` and `.gitcore`
- git clone the tpl repo: `gotplrepo` into `gomine`
```shell
git clone https://github.com/abtransitionit/gotplrepo.git gomine
```
- reset history and init repo
```shell
cd gomine
rm -rf .git
git init -b main  
```
- update `GO` path in the file `go.mod`
```shell
# do update
go mod init github.com/abtransitionit/gomine
# check updtae
cat go.mod
```
- commit the code "initial setup from template"
- update .git/config
```shell
git remote add origin https://github.com/abtransitionit/gomine.git
```
- push the code
```shell
git push -u origin main
```

## 2. Update the README
- update `gotplrepo` to `gomine`
- review each sections and update/add content when needed

# Todo

```go
var rootSDesc = "LUC  is a user-friendly, auto-documented command-line interface."
var rootLDesc = rootSDesc + ` It simplifies daily tasks for DevOps engineers and developers by providing a unified and consistent CLI experience. LUC can, for example:
	â†’ Manage containers and container images,
	â†’ Manage Linux OS packages and repositories using a unified interface â€” no need to worry about whether it's apt or dnf nor if it's debian, fedora or ubuntu
	â†’ Manage remote VM objects,
	â†’ Simplify the creation and management of Kubernetes clusters across virtual machines,
	â†’ ...and much more.

As a Linux cross-distribution CLI, LUC is also well-suited and ready for full automation and integration into any CI/CD pipelines.`
